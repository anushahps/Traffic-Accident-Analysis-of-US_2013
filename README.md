# Big Data Analysis of US Traffic Accidents-2013
This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns and high-risk areas using big data tools. The US Traffic Accident Dataset from Kaggle serves as the primary data source. The data is first ingested into HDFS, followed by initial cleaning and formatting using Apache Pig, including handling missing values and standardizing timestamps. Structured queries are performed in Hive to enable efficient data management and retrieval. PySpark is then used for in-depth analysis to determine peak accident hours, the most dangerous states and cities, and monthly trends in accident occurrences. The insights derived can assist policymakers, traffic authorities, and urban planners in implementing targeted safety measures and optimizing traffic management strategies. This beginner-friendly project demonstrates the integration of Hadoop ecosystem tools for large-scale data processing and analytics.
